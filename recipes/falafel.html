    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unlike most of America's other favorite fast foods, falafel is rarely attempted at home, which is a shame, since it's very simple to do, and even a relative novice like me can get some very decent results. One word of warning: you do need to know you're going to have a craving for this a full day before you actually want to eat it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
      <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
